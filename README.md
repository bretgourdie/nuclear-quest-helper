Use as a companion for Nuclear Quest to keep track of hands, decks, and nuclear radiation.

Click a deck to draw a card. Click the cardback to apply the card to a hand:
* If the card is a gamma radiation card, it will apply the gamma radiation to the slider
* If the card requires the player to draw a gamma radiation card, the gamma radiation card will be drawn automatically
* If the card forces a lost turn, the "lost turn" checkbox will be checked
* If 30 or more gamma radiation is drawn, the "lost turn" checkbox will be checked

Clicking on a drawn card returns it to the deck. If returning a gamma radiation card, the slider will be reduced automatically.
